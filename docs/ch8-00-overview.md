# Chapter 8: Vectors — Detailed Syllabus

## Overview and Purpose

This chapter introduces vectors as mathematical objects for modelling **position, displacement, direction, and magnitude**, and develops vector methods for solving **three-dimensional geometrical problems**. The emphasis is on linking **algebraic, geometric, and vector representations** and using vectors as a unifying language for spatial reasoning.
