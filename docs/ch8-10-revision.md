# Chapter 8: Vectors — Revision Map

---

## Big Picture: What This Chapter Is Doing

**Core unifying idea**
Vectors provide a **single mathematical framework** to:

* Describe position and movement
* Perform geometry in 2D and 3D
* Compute distances, angles, and alignments
* Replace diagrams with algebra

Think of the chapter as moving through three questions:

1. **What is a vector and how do I calculate with it?** → **8A**
2. **How do vectors describe geometry and shape?** → **8B**
3. **How do vectors describe angles and direction quantitatively?** → **8C**

## SECTION 8A — Vector Foundations (The Toolkit)

### What you must be fluent with

These are **non-negotiable skills** — everything else depends on them.

#### Representations

* Column vectors $\longleftrightarrow$ base vectors ( $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, $\mathbf{k}$ )
* Diagrammatic $\longleftrightarrow$ algebraic forms

#### Operations

* Addition and subtraction (component-wise)
* Scalar multiplication
* Zero vector
* Parallel vectors:
  $$
  \mathbf{b} = t\mathbf{a}
  $$

#### Length and Direction

* Magnitude:
  $$
  |\mathbf{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}
  $$
* Unit vectors:
  $$
  \frac{\mathbf{a}}{|\mathbf{a}|}
  $$

### Typical 8A questions

* “Write this vector in component / base-vector form”
* “Find the magnitude / unit vector”
* “Find values of constants so vectors are parallel”
* “Express one vector in terms of others”

## SECTION 8B — Geometry with Vectors (Structure and Proof)

### Core translations (memorise these)

| Geometry idea  | Vector expression                                 |                         |   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | - |
| Point position | ( $\mathbf{a} = \overrightarrow{OA}$ )              |                         |   |
| Displacement   | ( $\overrightarrow{AB} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$ ) |                         |   |
| Distance       | (                                                 | $\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$ | ) |
| Midpoint       | ( $\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})$ )          |                         |   |
| Parallel lines | Scalar multiple                                   |                         |   |
| Collinearity   | ( $\overrightarrow{AB} = k\overrightarrow{BC}$ )    |                         |   |

### Shape tests (high exam value)

#### Parallelogram

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{DC}
$$

#### Rhombus

* Parallelogram **and**
* Adjacent sides equal in magnitude

#### Collinearity

* One displacement vector is a scalar multiple of another

---

### Ratios and division

* Internal division:
  * Express movement as a **fraction of a displacement**
* Midpoints and section formulae arise naturally

---

### Typical 8B questions

* “Find the distance between two points”
* “Show that these points are collinear”
* “Show this quadrilateral is / is not a parallelogram or rhombus”
* “Find the coordinates of a point dividing a line in a given ratio”
* “Prove lines intersect / pass through a given point”

---

## SECTION 8C — Scalar Product and Angles (Direction and Measurement)

### Key formulas (must know cold)

#### Scalar (dot) product

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}
= |\mathbf{a}|,|\mathbf{b}|\cos\theta
= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3
$$

#### Angle between vectors

$$
\cos\theta
= \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{a}|,|\mathbf{b}|}
$$

#### Perpendicular vectors

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0
$$

---

### Interpretations to remember

* Dot product measures **alignment**
* Positive → similar direction
* Zero → perpendicular
* Negative → opposing direction

---

### Typical 8C questions

* “Find the angle between two vectors”
* “Find the angle at a point between two lines”
* “Show two vectors are perpendicular”
* “Find values of constants so vectors meet at right angles”

---

## How Sections Link Together (Very Exam-Relevant)

### Common problem flow

1. **8A**: Express vectors cleanly
2. **8B**: Build geometry using displacement vectors
3. **8C**: Measure angles or test perpendicularity

Example:

> “Find the angle between two sides of a shape in 3D”

* 8A → write vectors
* 8B → form displacement vectors
* 8C → apply dot product

---

## Strategy for Revision

* Practise **vector proofs without coordinates**
* Combine **ratios + dot products**
* Get comfortable moving between:
  * Words ↔ vectors ↔ equations

## One-Sentence Summary of the Chapter

> **Vectors turn geometry into algebra, make three dimensions manageable, and allow distances, angles, and shapes to be computed rather than guessed.**
